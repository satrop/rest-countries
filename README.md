### 📝 Brief

Your challenge is integrating with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end, such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:
- See all countries from the API on the homepage ✅
- Search for a country using an input field ✅
- Filter countries by region ✅
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page ✅
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page ✅
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size ✅
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page ✅
- Bonus: Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode ✅
